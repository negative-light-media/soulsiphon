# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SoulSiphon, a vanilla-like mod for Minecraft Java versions 1.19.0 - 1.20.0.
As a vanilla-like mod, some changes will not be accepted on the grounds of falling outside the scope the mod. These include but are not limited to:
- Chagnes to Terain Generation
  - New Structures
  - New Generated Blocks
- New Createive Mode Tabs

## Branches
1. `master` - The master branch is for the latest version of Minecraft and latest version of the mod.
2. Minecraft Versions (e.g., `1.19.0`) - The main branch for each version of Minecraft. These branches should be up to the latest version for that major update (e.g., `1.19.4`).
3. Development Branches - These branches should stem from issues and should come off of a Minecraft Version branch. This is where coding should take place.

## Development Process
1. Before any new feature or bug fix is developed, an issue should be created and reviewed.
2. Code should be created in a Development branch based off the version of the mod. No branches off master will be accepted.
3. Once the code is completed, it should be labeled "Ready". Official contributors will review the changes to ensure they meet all standards.
4. If the changes made do not fit in the current scope of Soul Siphon, they may be removed.

We suggest using IntelliJ IDE for development. We are not sponsored by nor affiliated with IntelliJ.

## Submitting Changes
1. Propose changes through GitHub Issues using the Feature Request template. Be clear in what you intend to add.

3. Once approved, the request can be assigned to a contributor, or you can create a fork of the project on the version you wish to start supporting that feature.

## Reporting Bugs
1. Use the Bug Report template for reporting bugs. Include all information that can help us identify and fix the bug.
