# Overview
Soul Siphon is a vanilla-like mod that lets the player turn Soul Sand into Sand, and do other soul-related crafting. 

By using the **Soul Siphon** (a modified Pointed Dripstone) the player can free souls trapped in their soul-block prisons. 

While some may wish to simply free the souls, others will harness them for their own purposes.
If the souls are extracted above a **Sculk Catalyst**, its lifeforce will be converted into more Sculk. 
If done above the new **Sculk Caudron** block instead, the soul will then be stored for later use in crafting.
